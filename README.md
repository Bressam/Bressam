## Hi there 🍏🤖🧙🏼‍♂️
### About me
I'm an experienced software developer specializing in iOS app development, with a degree in Computer Engineering from PUC-PR University. 

My journey in iOS development began in 2015 when I was accepted into the Apple Developer Academy, an official Apple developer program worldwide.

Since then, I've focused my career and projects on iOS development. I also spent 2 years as a Full Stack Engineer on the Siemens Grid Control team, working on engineering projects and writing code—something I also love—but my passion for iOS was greater.

### 🧙🏼‍♂️ My tech skills
I am constantly learning about cutting-edge concepts in mobile architecture and design patterns, improving code quality, performance, and especially application scalability.

I've been working in iOS development since 2017. These years of experience have given me extensive knowledge in various areas, including:
- Swift, RxSwift, Combine, and Objective-C;
- UIKit and SwiftUI;
- Build systems: Buck & Tuist;
- CI/CD, Fastlane;
- App Store: managing and maintaining subscriptions and in-app purchases;
- Video streaming and media management;
- Modularization of monolithic applications;


### ⚡ Fun fact
I've worked for companies all around the globe, both in-office and remotely. 

In 2023, I traveled to Taiwan for a week of in-office work with an important client, which significantly enhanced our company’s trust and the client’s confidence in our deliveries.


### 👨🏻‍💻 My other tech skills
Even though I specialize in iOS development, I've also studied other mobile technologies to improve communication across stacks in my daily work. I also have past experience as a Full Stack Engineer, working with Java, C, C++, and C#.

I received a 100% scholarship for a post-graduation program from my university. I chose a mobile development post-graduation course, where I improved my skills in the following areas:
- UI/UX design and component creation in Figma;
- Android and Flutter: Even though I don’t plan to work with these technologies, the main goal was to improve communication with other stack teams at work, and it has already yielded results in meetings;
- Backend development: Kotlin and Java with Spring Boot. Understanding how backend systems work is essential for personal projects.
