## Hi there 🍏🤖🧙🏼‍♂️
### About me
I'm an experienced software developer specialized in iOS app development, graduated on Computer Engineering at PUC-PR University.

My journey on iOS development started in 2015, when I got approved into the Apple Developer Academy, an official apple developer program worldwide.

Since then I kept focusing all my projects and carreer on iOS development, but also kept my hands on some engineering projects. I also worked 2 years as an FullStack Engineer at Siemens Grid Control team, keeping my hands on engineering projects and code that I also love, but my passion for iOS was greater.

### 🧙🏼‍♂️ My tech skills
I am constantly learning about cutting edge concepts around mobile architecture and design patterns, improving both code quality and code performance, always focusing on application scabability
I work with iOS development since 2017. All these years of development granted me a lot of knowledge on different topics, being the main ones:
 - Swift, RxSwift, Combine and Objective-C;
 - UIKit and SwiftUI;
 - Build systems: Buck & Tuist;
 - CI/CD, Fastlane;
 - Appstore: rules to manage and maintain subscription and in-app purchases;
 - Video streaming and media management;

### 👨🏻‍💻 My other tech skills
Even tough I am specialized into iOS development, I also studied about other mobile technologies to improve my communication between stacks on daily work, and also have some past work as a FullStack Engineer that is not public here, where I worked with Java, C, C++. C#.
I also gained an 100% scholarship for a post-graduation program from my university that I picked mobile development course, where I managed to improve the following stacks: 
 - UI/UX design and components creation on Figma;
 - Android and Flutter, even tough I don't plan to work with it, the main focus is to keep improving communication with other stack teams from work, it already showed worth on meetings;
 - Backend development, Kotlin and Java with springboot. Besides helping to understand how backend works, it is very important for personal projects;


### ⚡ Fun fact
I always worked on companies all around the globe, both in-office and remotely.
In 2023 I traveled to Taiwan to have an week of work in-office with our important client, that improved our company trust and confidence on our deliveries.
